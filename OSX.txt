This software is used to deploy Scala services to Docker containers.
Code is somewhat rough and still under development.

The following steps will set up a demo on OSX.
Some simpifications.

   The deploy machine is a local instance in a vm created via boot2docker.
   There is only one stack and one server in that stack.
   There is only a single service.
   No docker repo is used, instead only the local image cache is used.

Most of the folowing steps are initial setup. Once setup,
typically the only steps needed are 7 (build docker image)
and 10 (deploy).


1. IP Address

   Make sure you have a non 127.0.0.1 ip address
   (This may require you be on wifi).
   Make sure your hostname points to that ip.
   If not set your host name to that ip.

       sudo scutil --set HostName "a.b.c.d"

2. Make sure you have java 1.7

   java -version

3. Install boot2docker for osx 1.3.2

    https://github.com/boot2docker/osx-installer/releases

       boot2docker init
       boot2docker up
    
    run the listed export commands

    note the ip address for the virtual box vm typically 192.168.59.103 port 2376
    docker commnd should now be available

    Now you need to disable ssl

       boot2docker ssh

          sudo su -
          cat > /var/lib/boot2docker/profile
          DOCKER_TLS=no
          ^D

    Exit the vm and then 

       boot2docker stop
       boot2docker start

    Again run the listed export commands

4. Build docker base image

    in WP_Deploy/base

       ./buildBase

    check this worked with

       docker images 

5. Build docker sbt plugin.

    in WP_Deploy/docker

       sbt publish-local

6. Build scala framework (used by sample app and agent)

    in WP_Scala_Framework

       sbt publish-local

7. Build docker image for sample application

    in WP_Deploy/sample

       sbt docker

    check this worked with

       docker images

8. Override the agent config

   Copy

       WP_Deploy/agenet/override/service-agent.conf 
  
   to directory 

       ~/.wpscala

   Edit this file

        akka.remote.netty.tcp.hostname 

     should be the local ip (from step 1)

        wp.service-agent.containerHost
        wp.clients.docker.host
     
     should both be the ip of the docker vm (from step 3)

        wp.clients.docker.port

     should be the docker port (from step 3)
   
9. Run the agent

    in WP_Deploy/agent 

       sbt run

10. Run the command handler

   in WP_Deploy/deploy

       sbt run -local

    You should see a deploy> prompt, type the following

       help
       services
       service sample-app
       stacks
       stack local
       status
       versions
       deploy 0.0.3
       status
       quit

   You can see the service is running with the following command

       curl http://192.168.59.103:8888/admin:info?opt:pretty
